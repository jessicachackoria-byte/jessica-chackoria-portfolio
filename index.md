# Jessica Chackoria — Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio features dashboards and code from people-related data projects.

## Public Dashboards

Here are examples of dashboards I have developed using Tableau to meet stakeholder needs, ranging from routine reporting to program review and strategic planning.  
These projects showcase skills in data visualization, stakeholder engagement, and translating complex information into actionable insights—capabilities that are highly applicable to **People Analytics**, **Organizational Effectiveness**, and **Institutional Research**. All dashboards are publicly available.
